# arduinOO
OOP for Arduino's

Using classes inside other classes is a pain in the original Arduino IDE. 
This is no problem using an IDE like eclipse. On the other side, eclipse is not
made to work with arduino's, but it's flexibel due to plugins. The following plugin
solves all this problems, since you don't have to miss any functionality of the 
original Arduino IDE but all the advantages of eclipse:

Arduino Eclipse Plugin V2.x - http://www.baeyens.it/eclipse/V2

To use the plugin, the installation of the original Arduino IDE (v1.6.5) is still needed.
All other instructions are found on the "baeyens"-Homepage.

The cloned libs folder in this repository can be defined as the private Library path.
